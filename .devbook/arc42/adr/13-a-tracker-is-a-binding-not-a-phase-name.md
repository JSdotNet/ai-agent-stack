# 13. A Tracker Is a Binding, Not a Phase Name

The closing phase that reports a finished run to the work item is **Work Item Update**, not
GitHub Issue Update. The ported skills named GitHub in the phase itself, in the stage list every
one of them passes to `start_run`, and in their prose.

A phase that names one implementation cannot be bound to another. `bindings["delivery.tracker"]`
is the whole point: GitHub issues, Jira tickets, and Markdown chapters are three
implementations of `find_item`, `read_item`, `create_item`, `comment`, `transition`, and
`link_change`, and a repository that plans work as Markdown has been doing the third all along.

Consequence: the stage name changed in 32 skills at once, so a run resumed from state written
before this release finds a stage name that no longer matches. Nothing resumes across it,
because nothing has run yet — which is the one moment this rename is free.
