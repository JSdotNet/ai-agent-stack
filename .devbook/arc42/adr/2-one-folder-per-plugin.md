# 2. One Folder Per Plugin

```

Every plugin is self-contained under `plugins/<name>/`, with its own manifests and assets. It
installs and works alone, or it declares what it needs and lets the host enforce that.

Three ways to couple, and only the first is a dependency:

| Coupling | Use it for | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hard dependency | A lower layer the plugin cannot work without | Declared with a version range; the host resolves it, and an illegal combination becomes unreachable. |
| Bridge plugin | Something that needs two stacks at once | Its own plugin, depending on both. Neither side learns about the other. |
| Surface capability | A dashboard, a canvas, a collector | Named capability resolved from the live tool list, no-op when absent. Never a dependency. |

A role, a tracker, or a specialist agent is bound per repository and is never a dependency: one
missing specialist must not take every skill that names it down with it.
