One file per plugin: its responsibility, the interfaces it exposes, the parts inside it, the
flows that cross it, and its dependencies in their actual direction.
[Chapter 5](../05-building-block-view.md) holds what every plugin shares — the landscape, the
folder shape, what an install leaves in a repository — and links here for the rest. The
vocabulary every block is written in is [chapter 8](../08-crosscutting-concepts.md); the terms
one block owns are in the [glossary](../12-glossary.md).

**One plugin, one block.** A plugin is the unit a host installs, versions, and can refuse to
load, so it is already the line a model cannot cross without somebody declaring it. Fourteen
files follow the fourteen plugin folders under `plugins/`, name for name.

**The plugins are the truth.** Each file is one sync unit, and chapter 5's file-level block
sets `sync: pull` for all of them: when a block and its plugin disagree, the sweep rewrites the
block from what the plugin ships. A block that should lead its plugin instead states its own
`sync` in its file-level block; none does today. The levels and values are "Sync direction" in
`devbook-chapter-metadata.md`.

## The set

```meta
```

| Block | Layer | In one line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [devbook](devbook.md) | L0 foundation | Addressed Markdown chapters, the `meta` block under them, the check, the reconcile that puts the convention into a repository, and the five procedures every repository has and no plugin can write — `run`, `capture`, `diagnose`, `estimate`, `prototype` — each with a goal devbook fixes and a body the repository owns |
| [devbook-derived](devbook-derived.md) | L1 on devbook | The committed `_meta/` index, its refresh paths, and the canvas that draws the graph |
| [devbook-openspec](devbook-openspec.md) | L1 on devbook | The change lane: OpenSpec installed and configured so a change is a set of deltas against the chapters, proposed, agreed, built step by step, and archived |
| [devbook-collaboration](devbook-collaboration.md) | L1 on devbook | Who owes the next move on a chapter: review requests, findings, and the approval decision |
| [devbook-skills](devbook-skills.md) | L0 foundation | Reusable guidance any plugin names and none depends on: `show-me`, a picture before the prose, `research-brief`, a cited answer from primary sources, `pr-body`, a pull request description that declares its door, and `retro`, what to change after a session went badly |
| [devbook-config](devbook-config.md) | L0 foundation | What this stack is, what this machine has, and how this repository is wired |
| [delivery](delivery.md) | L0 foundation | One unit of work carried from request to review-ready change inside one session |
| [delivery-schedule](delivery-schedule.md) | L1 on delivery | Work that runs with nobody watching, and the catalog of triggers that fires it |
| [delivery-surface-dashboard](delivery-surface-dashboard.md) | Surface | The live view of a run, measured by hooks rather than told |
| [delivery-surface-canvas](delivery-surface-canvas.md) | Surface | Mermaid and Markdown rendered live beside the files they came from |
| [delivery-surface-collector](delivery-surface-collector.md) | Surface | A run recorded to disk rather than watched, for unattended sessions |
| [delivery-surface-backlog](delivery-surface-backlog.md) | Surface | A run shown in the Backlog desktop app, where its work item already lives |
| [delivery-run-view](delivery-run-view.md) | Viewer | A run drawn inside Claude Code from the files the surfaces write; not a surface |

The delivery engine and devbook are the two blocks everything else serves: the engine carries
work, and devbook is what the work is grounded in and what it writes back to. The four
surfaces answer one published contract and are interchangeable, which is the whole reason
there is more than one.
