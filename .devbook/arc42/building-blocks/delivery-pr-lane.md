```

The pull-request lane of the [delivery](delivery.md) engine, a block inside it. Responsible for
one thing: that a finished change gets reviewed and merge-ready, whether a flow produced it or
not.

Inside the block: the four lane skills, and the git workflow a tracker reports with an item.

Outside it: opening the pull request at the end of a run, which is
[`phase-create-pr`](delivery-phases.md#phase-create-pr); checking out the branch a run works on,
which is [`phase-update-base`](delivery-phases.md#phase-update-base); and raising a pull request
by hand, which is the host's own action.

## Interfaces

```meta
related: [".devbook/arc42/building-blocks/delivery.md#interfaces"]
```

Four skills, each reached by a person, on a change a flow did or did not produce.
`pr-merge-ready` uses the other three as its tools.

### push-branch

```meta
related: [".devbook/arc42/building-blocks/delivery-pr-lane.md#pull-request-lane"]
```

Push the current branch and set its upstream, and stop there. No pull request opens: this is
the step for getting commits onto the remote so CI runs.

### update-pr-branch

```meta
related: [".devbook/arc42/building-blocks/delivery-pr-lane.md#pull-request-lane"]
```

Bring a pull request branch level with its base, resolve the conflicts, re-validate, and push.
For a branch that is behind, or that a required up-to-date check is blocking.

### fix-pr-checks

```meta
related: [".devbook/arc42/building-blocks/delivery-pr-lane.md#pull-request-lane"]
```

Read a failing job's logs, reproduce locally, classify the failure, fix it, and push until the
checks go green.

### pr-merge-ready

```meta
related: [".devbook/arc42/building-blocks/delivery-pr-lane.md#pull-request-lane"]
```

Score one pull request against the merge-ready checklist and clear its blockers, using the
other three lane skills as its tools. One pull request per pass.

## Structure

```meta
related: [".devbook/arc42/building-blocks/delivery.md#model"]
```

One domain service and the enum it holds. The lane takes no part in a run's model: it acts on
the pull request a run leaves behind, or on one no run produced.

### Pull Request Lane

```meta
related: [".devbook/arc42/12-glossary.md#pr-lane"]
```

Getting a finished change reviewed and merge-ready: push the branch, bring it level with its
base, fix the checks that fail, and score it against the merge-ready checklist. Raising the
pull request itself is the host's own action rather than a skill here.

Invocation semantics: command-invoked, and separately from a run. These skills are the one
part of this block routinely used on a change no flow produced. With the `pr-lane` slot
unbound, `create-pr` writes file artifacts only and opens nothing.

| Invariant | Enforced at | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raising the pull request is the host's own action, never a skill here | the lane skills | untested |
| The lane runs separately from a run, on a change no flow produced | the lane skills | untested |
| With the `pr-lane` slot unbound, `create-pr` writes file artifacts only and opens nothing | `phase-create-pr` | untested |
| An item the tracker reports as part of a change runs on the branch its workflow names; the engine reads the workflow and never chooses it | `phase-update-base` | untested |
| A proposal's status follows its pull request, and the engine writes none of it | `phase-create-pr` | untested |

**Git Workflow** (enum) is `single-branch` or `proposal-first`, reported by the tracker with
the item. `single-branch` works the whole change on `change/<name>` and opens one pull request
on the closing run, after the acceptance and archive it carries. A step there is a commit,
`done` once its tasks are ticked. `proposal-first` gives the proposal `change/<name>`, each
step `step/<name>/<N>`, and the close `archive/<name>`, one pull request each, the proposal's
opened as a draft. The step prefix is not `change/` because git refuses a ref that is both a
leaf and a directory.

## Dependencies

```meta
related: [".devbook/arc42/building-blocks/delivery.md#dependencies"]
```

A part of delivery, shipped and versioned with it. What the plugin as a whole depends on is
[delivery's own table](delivery.md#dependencies).

### Outbound

```meta
```

| Depends on | Pattern | Mechanism | Contract | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub, through `gh` | Conformist | Pushing a branch, reading a failing job's logs, and scoring a pull request | The `gh` command line | The lane works on a pull request where it lives. |
| A bound tracker | Binding, never a dependency | Reports an item's git workflow with the item | `bindings["delivery.tracker"]` | The engine reads the workflow and never chooses it. |

### Inbound

```meta
```

| Consumer | Pattern | Mechanism | Contract | What it relies on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [delivery-phases](delivery-phases.md#phase-update-base) | Same plugin | `phase-create-pr` and `phase-update-base` work on the branch the git workflow names, and `phase-update-base` leaves a branch with an open pull request to `update-pr-branch` | The Git Workflow enum | That the branch names keep their shape. |
| [delivery](delivery.md#start-session-from-issue) | Same plugin | `start-session-from-issue` names `pr-merge-ready` as the next step for finished work | The skill name | That one pull request is taken to merge-ready per pass. |
| [delivery-schedule](delivery-schedule-entry-points.md#schedule-merge-review) | Separate Ways | `schedule-merge-review` reports what `pr-merge-ready` fixes with a person present | The skill name alone | That the attended counterpart exists; the review never fixes anything itself. |
