# delivery-run-view

A delivery run drawn inside Claude Code itself — its phases top to bottom, how each one ran,
and the phase this session is in — from the run files the surfaces already write.

A viewer, not a surface. It answers none of the surface contract's operations, writes no run
file, declares no dependency, and names no engine. The one thing it sends anywhere is a gate
reply the person presses, submitted to this session as their own prompt. Whichever surfaces record a run, this plugin
reads what they left on disk and draws it; uninstalling it costs a view, never a capability.

That is also why it is not called `delivery-surface-*`. Per
`plugins/delivery/resources/surface-contract.md`, that prefix means an MCP server answering the
contract, and the engine resolves every installed `delivery-surface-*` server as a place to
record a run. A plugin that only reads would be mistaken for one. It keeps the subsystem's stem,
`delivery`, and is named for what it shows: a run.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add JSdotNet/devbook
```

Then enable `delivery-run-view` with `/plugin`. Nothing else is required: the hook module is
loaded by Claude Code itself, and the pane opens on its own once a run of the session appears.

## Claude Code only

The plugin is function-hook modules — `hooks/hooks.json` names `./register.tsx` under
`modules` — and Copilot has no equivalent. So it carries the Claude manifest alone: a plugin
ships the manifest of every host that can load something in it, per
`.devbook/arc42/05-building-block-view.md` under *Plugin Folder*, and here that is one host.
It is the mirror of `delivery-surface-canvas`, which is Copilot's alone.

## What it draws

| Where | Shows |
|---|---|
| Pane — `/flows`, opened on its own the first time a run of this session appears | While this session's run is at Personal Validation, a review card first: the stage's review links, the Ready stage's open items, and **Approve** (the primary button), **Revise**, and **Reject**, each behind a coloured ✓, ↺, or ✗ and each submitting the gate's reply to this session as the person's prompt — `Personal Validation: approve.`, `… revise.`, `… decline.`. Then the run top to bottom, one row per phase: its status, how it ran (`inline`, `delegate`, `fork`, `gate`), the agent, model and effort, `≠` when it did not run as configured, the duration, and `↺N` when the phase ran more than once. Sub-agents the phase delegated to hang under it, those a revise round ran under the gate marked as such. The focused phase opens in place with its output, its skill, MCP servers, and chores, what was configured against what ran where they differ, QA scenarios, links, output tokens, and tool calls. `‹ ›` steps between runs, and a phase name focuses or unfocuses it |
| Band above the prompt | While this session's run is open: the flow, the stage rail, and the current phase with its mode |
| Inline tool rows | A `mcp__*delivery-surface-*__start_run` or `__update_stage` call in the transcript drawn as one line — the flow and its phases, or the phase and its new status — instead of raw JSON |
| Status line | `◆ PV: <repo> <run title>` while any checkout's run waits at a gate — `+N` when more do, this session's first — else `<skillId> · <current stage>` while this session's run is open |
| Toast and sound | Once per transition, when a stage of any checkout's run turns `waiting` or `blocked`: one short toast line — `◆ PV Budget · Monthly totals`, `✗ Ready Backlog · TaskCard for the Board` — and `sounds/gate.wav` |
| `/flows-demo` | A simulated `flow-code` run played in the pane, one phase every four seconds, held in memory only — no run file is written |

## Where it reads

Every three seconds it reads the newest run files under the profile, at
`~/.claude/delivery-surface-dashboard/<slug>-<hash>/runs/*.json` and
`~/.claude/backlog/<slug>-<hash>/runs/*.json` — `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in place of `~/.claude`
when set — where `<slug>` is the checkout's folder name. A worktree with no runs of its own
falls back to the main checkout's, so the pane is never empty in a fresh worktree. The same
run found in both places is shown once, the newer copy winning. This session's runs sort first,
by the `sessionIds` a run records.

For the gate alert it also reads every other checkout's folders under both surfaces — every
fifteen seconds, since a profile holds hundreds of them, and at once on `/flows` — only the
run files modified in the last day and only runs not yet done, so a run parked a week ago does
not keep ringing. Each file is parsed once per modification time.

The run file shape is the dashboard's, which the Backlog app writes too. It is not part of the
surface contract, so a surface that changes its file shape can break this view without breaking
the contract; a run file that does not parse is skipped and read again on the next poll.

## How a phase ran

The surface contract records it twice, and this view reads both: the run's
`runContext.phases.<flow>.<phase-skill>` — what the flow-runner resolved from the config —
and each stage's `execution`, what actually ran, which wins where both speak. A stage joins
its entry by its title's slug, `Build & Test` to `phase-build-test`, `Create Pull Request` to
`phase-create-pr`, and the stage names of an engine before 1.18.0 to the phases that replaced
them.

The agent is the recorded one, else the sub-agent that did the phase's work: the configured
agent when it ran or a `delivery:runner-<effort>` carried it, else the longest-running, so a
helper such as `qa:qa-monitor` beside the agent never names the phase. `≠` marks a
configured agent that never ran, a model or effort other than the configured one, and a
`fallback` — a configured id that did not resolve.

A run that records neither — every run started before the engine recorded them — is
inferred and drawn dimmed with a `?`: a phase with a delegated sub-agent in the run's
`insights` is `delegate`, Personal Validation is the `gate`, and every other phase is
`inline`. A fork is never detected that way, and nothing can be compared with the config.

## Gates

No surface records `awaiting_approval`: a gate stage — Personal Validation, or one whose
`execution.mode` is `gate` — that is `in_progress` is read as waiting on its person. Every
poll compares each stage's tone with the last poll's, kept per `<run id>#<stage index>` in
`$.state`, and a stage that turned `waiting` or `blocked` raises one toast and one sound. The
first poll of a session takes the baseline and alerts nothing; a gate already waiting shows on
the status line instead. A reload keeps the baseline, because `$.state` outlives the module.

The sound plays where the surface has a player — the desktop app, a macOS terminal; a Windows or
Linux terminal plays nothing, and the toast and status line say it alone.

The card's links are clickable where the host allows a link — `https:`, or
`http://localhost`. Any other address, `http://127.0.0.1` or a demo's `file:`, is drawn as
text beside its label. Open items are the Ready stage's `output` after `Open items`, split on
`(1)` numbering or on list lines. Revise sends no notes: the flow-runner asks for them, as it
does for a typed `revise`. In `/flows-demo` the buttons only say what they would send.

## The state contract

`types/index.d.ts` declares the plugin's `$.state` — `runs`, `selected`, `focus`, and
`seen` under `delivery-run-view` — and the manifest's `types` key points at it, which is what
`claude plugin validate` checks the module's state reads and writes against. The
`.claude-plugin/types/` folder `tsconfig.json` extends is written by the host for type-checking
and is ignored.
