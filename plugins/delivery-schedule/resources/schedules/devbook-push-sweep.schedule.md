Run `schedule-devbook-sweep` with `direction: push` for the repository `{{repo}}` on `{{base}}`,
with `maxResolve {{maxResolve}}`. It brings the code level with the agreed chapters of every sync group at
`push` or `sync`: up to {{maxResolve}} `spec-ahead` groups are built one at a time, failing test
first, each on its own branch under `schedule/{{name}}/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`, each opened as a **draft** pull request whose body leads with
what could not be proved. A `sync` group that also reads `code-ahead` waits for the pull sweep.
It writes no chapter, removes no code, skips every chapter at `draft` or `proposed`, and
nothing it opens is ready for review.

The brief is the report: the draft pull requests with what to validate, the groups awaiting an
answer, the chapters skipped as not agreed, what did not complete, and the
`devbook-sync-report` block.
