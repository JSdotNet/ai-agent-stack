Run `schedule-issue-sweep` for the repository `{{repo}}` on `{{base}}` over every open issue,
with `maxResolve {{maxResolve}}` and `labelConfidence high`. Every issue nobody has classified yet gets
its labels from the repository's own set; an issue high-confidence evidence shows already
fixed, obsolete, or a duplicate is closed with that evidence in the comment — the one closure
the preamble allows; up to {{maxResolve}} of the rest are resolved one at a time, each on its own
branch under `schedule/{{name}}/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`, each opened as a **draft** pull request whose
body says what could not be proved. Nothing else is closed, nothing is ready for review.

The brief is the report: the draft pull requests with what to validate, the proposals
awaiting an answer, the flagged issues, what did not complete, what was closed.
