name: flow-code
description: 'Run any change to a repository outside its devbook folders, end to end — a feature or an incremental change, a bug fix, a structure or layout refactor, a new module, service, or first product increment, the tooling, CI, scripting, and housekeeping around them, a dependency, SDK, or framework move, and creating and scaffolding a repository. One tier for every kind: scope, implement with review per slice, build and test, verify, spec check, the ready check, and personal approval before the pull request. Missing scope, acceptance criteria, reproduction steps, or architecture context is derived in scope rather than being a reason to skip the flow. DO NOT USE FOR: a devbook chapter (flow-spec).'

# Flow: Code Change

Open the reply with `delivery@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

Required input: one line naming the outcome — the behaviour, the broken behaviour, the move, the
update, or the thing to create. Everything else is derived in `phase-scope`.

## Phases

One tier for every kind, defined in `resources/flow-phases.md`; who runs each phase is resolved
per `resources/phase-resolution.md`:

`phase-update-base` → `phase-scope` → `phase-plan` (`create` only) → `phase-implement` ⇄
`phase-review`, per slice → `phase-build-test` → `phase-verify` → `phase-spec-check` →
`phase-ready` → `phase-personal-validation` → `phase-create-pr` → `phase-report-back` →
`phase-summary`

## Kinds

`phase-scope` derives the kind from this table and persists it as `changeKind`. The kind changes
what happens inside `phase-implement` — in full in `resources/implement-kinds.md` — and how deep
`phase-verify` goes, never which phases run:

| Kind | Covers | Inside `phase-implement` | `phase-verify` depth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature` | New or changed behaviour, a small UI tweak | Tests first at each backend seam, none on the frontend; frontend, backend, or both | Full with capture for new behaviour, targeted for a change |
| `create` | A new module, service, or first runnable increment; carving one out | The unit `phase-plan` laid out | Full with capture |
| `refactor` | Folder, project, or solution layout, test placement, reference updates — behaviour held still | The moves and reference updates scope listed | Targeted, on the affected flows |
| `defect` | Something is broken | The failing test that reproduces it, then the fix | Targeted: the reproduction plus the regression scenario |
| `config` | Tooling, CI, scripts, documentation outside the devbook folders, housekeeping | The change, unsplit | Startup only, or `skipped` with nothing to run |
| `dependency` | Package, SDK, and framework moves | Analysis, the baseline for a framework upgrade, reversible batches, the security scan, feature adoption | Startup only; smoke checks for a framework upgrade |
| `project` | Creating and scaffolding a repository | Stack setup, README and instructions, governance, CI, tooling, then the scaffold | Full with capture: the app host, health endpoints, smoke checks |

- A request that is "really" a service, a move, or a scaffold is a different kind, not a
  different flow.
- A new architectural decision, bounded context, or cross-cutting redesign escalates to
  `flow-spec` per **Escalation** in `resources/flow-execution-model.md`.
- `project`: creating the repository stays manual and happens before the run; Update Base
  skips while there is no remote.
- `dependency`: a major version is raised with the user before it is taken, and nothing merges
  its own dependency bump.

## Surface Reporting

Per **Reporting Contract** in `resources/surface-contract.md`; with no surface bound, say so
once and continue on the file artifacts.

- `start_run` with `skillId: "flow-code"`, `sessionId: "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"` per the
  `session-id` slot, and one stage per phase above in order, each named by its phase skill's
  title: Update Base, Scope, Plan (a `create` run only), Implement, Review, Build & Test, Verify,
  Spec Check, Ready, Personal Validation, Create Pull Request, Report Back, Summary.
- `set_run_context` with `changeKind` as soon as Scope derives it.
- Render the scope record, the plan, or the drafted bug report with `render_markdown`, and its
  Mermaid with `render_diagram`.
