description: 'Run any change to a devbook folder — an arc42/ chapter, decision record, debt record, or proposal; a domain/ context map or bounded context; the tech/ technology graph; design/ tokens and guidelines; the ai/ adoption record. One flow for the five folders: scope derives the folder and the kind, drafting runs through the agent the folder binds under the repository''s own instruction files, check and review runs the repository''s check, and the ready check and personal approval come before the pull request. The escalation target for a new decision, a cross-cutting redesign, a boundary question, and accepted debt. DO NOT USE FOR: the code that implements a chapter, or the dependency behind a tech/ entry (flow-code), or wireframes, prototypes, and UI reviews (the ux agent directly).'

# Flow: Devbook Folder (`arc42/`, `domain/`, `tech/`, `design/`, `ai/`)

Open the reply with `delivery@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

What a chapter must look like is the repository's rule, not this flow's: the instruction files
that govern the target path and the check the repository ships own structure, metadata,
templates, status, and every folder-specific rule. This flow restates none of them.

Required input: the change goal. The folder, the chapters in scope, and the kind are derived in
`phase-scope`.

## Phases

Its own, shorter tier, defined in `resources/flow-phases.md`; who runs each phase is resolved
per `resources/phase-resolution.md`:

`phase-update-base` → `phase-scope` → `phase-drafting` → `phase-check-review` → `phase-ready`,
back to `phase-drafting` while not ready → `phase-personal-validation` → `phase-create-pr` →
`phase-report-back` → `phase-summary`

- **Scope** settles the folder and the kind. For `arc42/`: chapter content, a decision record,
  a debt record, or a proposal, which is a decision record in `proposed` status. A folder the
  repository has not adopted stops the run there: adopting one is devbook's own `init` or
  `update`.
- **An `ai/` usage whose tool has no `tech/` chapter,** or a `tech/` entry whose choice is an
  open decision, runs this flow for that folder first.

## Folder → Drafting Entry

The folder qualifies `phase-drafting`, so each folder names its own agent, model, and effort:

| Folder | `phases` entry | Drafts |
|---|---|---|
| `arc42/` | `phase-drafting:arc42` | Architecture chapters, decision and debt records |
| `domain/` | `phase-drafting:domain` | The context map and bounded contexts |
| `tech/` | `phase-drafting:tech` | The technology graph and its ratings |
| `design/` | `phase-drafting:design` | Principles, tokens, component guidelines |
| `ai/` | `phase-drafting:ai` | The AI adoption record |

## Surface Reporting

Per **Reporting Contract** in `resources/surface-contract.md`; with no surface bound, say so
once and continue on the file artifacts.

- `start_run` with `skillId: "flow-spec"`, `sessionId: "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"` per the
  `session-id` slot, and one stage per phase above in order, each named by its phase skill's
  title: Update Base, Scope, Drafting, Check & Review, Ready, Personal Validation, Create Pull
  Request, Report Back, Summary.
- During Drafting, render the drafted chapter with `render_markdown` and any changed Mermaid
  with `render_diagram`.
