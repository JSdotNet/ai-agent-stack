description: 'Move the delivery engine''s record in a repository forward — run its outstanding config migrations, rewriting extensions, delivery.roles, and delivery.mcp into the phase maps, release any file an earlier engine seeded, so the repository''s own procedure skills are its own, and rewrite components.delivery in .devbook/config.json to the installed pluginVersion. Materializes nothing. Refused where no components.delivery stamp exists: run delivery:init. Use when: upgrading the delivery engine, the stack config still carries extensions or delivery.roles, or components.delivery still claims a seeded start or capture skill. Triggers on: "delivery update", "update delivery", "upgrade delivery", "migrate to phase maps".'

# delivery update

Open the reply with `delivery@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

The engine materializes nothing. Everything it reads from a repository is either
`.devbook/config.json` — the engine-owned keys, which `devbook-config:init` writes — or
a skill the repository owns and the engine names by name: `run` behind `phase-verify`, `capture`
inside it. Neither is a dependency; a flow that finds one absent does without and
says so. So `delivery:init` records the engine, and this skill keeps the record current and
releases what an earlier engine wrote.

The stamp rules — the two shared fields, the hash, what customized and orphan mean — are
`assets/reconcile-protocol.md` in the devbook plugin under **The stamp**, followed exactly.
This plugin writes `components.delivery` and no other entry; it rewrites the engine-owned
keys only through a migration, which is the rename exception in that same protocol.

**Refuse when `components.delivery` is absent.** Say "not initialized, run `delivery:init`"
and stop.

## The run

1. **Migrate.** Run each script under `../../migrations/` in number order with node, the
   repository root as the working directory: `migrate.mjs --check`, and while it exits `1`,
   show its plan and every note under it, run it without `--check`, then show `git diff` of
   `.devbook/config.json` and name each overlay it rewrote. Pass `--plugin <name>=<path>` for
   a plugin a note says is not installed here when the person can point at it. `001` rewrites
   `extensions`, `delivery.roles`, `delivery.mcp`, a gate on an extension point, and a map
   under a retired flow into the two complete phase maps; its notes are what a person still
   decides. Then run `../../tools/stack-config/check.mjs` and fix until it exits `0`.
2. **Detect.** Read `components.delivery`. An entry under `materialized` — an earlier engine
   seeded `.agents/skills/start.md`, `.agents/skills/capture.md`, and a wrapper per host — is
   a file this engine no longer claims.
3. **Plan.** One table — `orphan` for every such entry, nothing else — and write nothing.
   Never skip this, not even when the plan is empty.
4. **Orphan.** Drop every `materialized` entry from the stamp. Delete no file: each stays where
   it is, the repository's own, until whichever install owns procedures adopts it or the
   repository removes it. Name each path in the report.
5. **Stamp.** Rewrite `components.delivery` as `pluginVersion` alone.
6. **Report** what was migrated and released, the migration's notes first, and leave the commit to the user.
