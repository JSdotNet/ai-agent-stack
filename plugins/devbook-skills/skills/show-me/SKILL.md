description: 'Explain with a picture before prose: pick the diagram, tree, signature, diff, or table that shows what the content describes, put it first, and keep the words after it to what the picture cannot say. Use when explaining code, a change, a plan, or a design in chat; writing a pull request description; reporting a stage or a gate back to a person; or writing a chapter section that describes steps, states, parts, files, or shapes. Triggers on: "show me", "/show-me", "explain visually", "draw it", "diagram this", "too much text", "wall of text", "make this readable", "how does this fit together".'

# Show Me

Open the reply with `devbook-skills@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

Show the shape first, then say only what the shape cannot. A person takes in a picture faster
than the paragraph describing it.

## Pick the picture

| The content describes | Show |
| --- | --- |
| Steps in order, or a request passing between parts | Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` or `flowchart` |
| Something that moves through states | Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` |
| Parts and how they connect | Mermaid `flowchart` or `classDiagram` |
| Files or folders and what each is for | A shallow tree in a code block, one short label per entry |
| The shape of a type, an interface, or a function | Its signature as fenced code, body omitted |
| What changed in an existing structure | A fenced `diff` with only the lines that moved |
| How control passes through functions | An indented call stack, one call per line |
| An algorithm or a decision rule | Five to ten lines of pseudocode |
| Options or items compared on the same points | A table |

Content with no shape (one fact, one answer, one instruction) gets one plain sentence.

## Rules

- Put the picture before the prose. The prose after it gives the reasons, the exceptions, and
  the limits. Never narrate the picture part by part.
- Keep a diagram to about nine nodes. Split a larger one by concern rather than shrinking the
  labels.
- Label with the names the code and the glossary use. Never coin a name for the picture.
- Use plain Markdown only: Mermaid, fenced code, and tables, which render on both hosts and on
  GitHub. Never use ASCII art for something Mermaid can draw.
- One picture per idea. A second picture of the same thing is noise.
- The caller's structure wins. A chapter keeps the sections its folder rule names, a pull
  request keeps the repository's template, and a stage report keeps the engine's fields. This
  skill decides how each part reads, never which parts exist.
