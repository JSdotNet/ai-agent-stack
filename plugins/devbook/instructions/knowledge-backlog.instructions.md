# Backlog knowledge (`.backlog`)

`.backlog` tracks planned and in-progress work as durable Markdown
artifacts, separate from whatever issue tracker or project board is in use
day to day. Items are not typed as epics/features/stories/bugs — a work
item is simply an item, optionally broken into sub-items.

## Context-loading policy

- `.backlog` is **not** baseline repository context. Load it for planning,
  backlog-writing, or issue-authoring tasks, and when a change needs to know
  what work is already tracked for the area it touches.
- When `.backlog` is needed as task context, load only the relevant concern
  file(s) instead of reading the whole folder by default.

## Relationship to other knowledge folders

- `.domain`, `.arc42`, `.tech`, and `.design` describe stable knowledge (domain
  model, architecture, stack, design guidelines). `.backlog` describes *change* —
  the work items that move the system from its current state toward the target
  state described there.
- Backlog items should reference the bounded context(s) in `.domain` they
  affect and any arc42 sections or ADRs they touch, instead of restating that
  context inline.

## Structure

```
.backlog/
  <concern-type>-<concern-slug>.md
```

`.backlog` can hold multiple files, split by concern rather than by work
item type. Each file groups the work items for one concern as chapters, with
sub-items nested as sub-chapters within the same file — the same way
`domain.md` nests Entities/Value Objects/Enums under their owning Aggregate.

### Filename convention

`<concern-type>-<concern-slug>.md`, where `concern-type` is one of:

- `domain` — work scoped to one bounded context; `concern-slug` matches the
  `.domain/<bounded-context-name>` folder name
  (e.g. `domain-order-management.md`).
- `feature` — work scoped to a cross-cutting feature that spans bounded
  contexts; `concern-slug` is the feature name
  (e.g. `feature-checkout.md`).
- `architecture` — work scoped to an architectural concern; `concern-slug`
  matches the relevant `.arc42` chapter/topic
  (e.g. `architecture-observability.md`).

Do not sort items into type-named subfolders (`epics/`, `bugs/`, etc.) — the
folder is organized by concern, not by item type.

```markdown
# <Concern Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
\`\`\`

## <Item Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
\`\`\`

Description of the item.

### <Sub-item Name>

\`\`\`meta
status: draft
\`\`\`

Description of the sub-item.

### <Next Sub-item Name>

...

## <Next Item Name>

...
```

## Authoring guidance

- Draft new items in a consistent format before saving them here. Where the
  repository has story/epic/bug authoring skills installed, use them — they
  shape content quality, not a stored type label.
- Publish or sync a ready backlog artifact to the issue tracker with the
  repository's issue-creation workflow — do not hand-author issue bodies that
  diverge from the saved artifact.
- Keep item status current in the `meta` block's `status` field so the
  folder reflects real backlog state, not just history. This folder's
  `status` field uses `draft`, `ready`, `in-progress`, `done`, or `blocked` —
  it tracks task progress, since backlog items describe work to be executed.
- **`status` is required on every `.backlog` block, with no resting value to
  omit** — unlike `.domain`, `.arc42`, and `.design`, where an absent status
  means settled content. Work has no resting state: every value here is a real
  position in the flow, and an item that states none is untracked, not `done`.
- `depends-on`, `implements`, `related`, and `issue` are omitted from the
  template above rather than written empty, per the omit-when-empty rule in
  `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md`; add each one when it carries a
  value.
- For end-to-end work spanning planning through implementation, route through
  the repository's feature or bug orchestration rather than working ad hoc from
  these files alone.
- Every Item and Sub-item must carry the metadata block described in
  `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md` (status, cross-folder tags,
  issue link) — required for the derived index and graph tooling.
- Every `.backlog/<concern-type>-<concern-slug>.md` file must also carry the
  file-level metadata block described in
  `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md`, placed directly
  under the file's top-level `# <Concern Name>` heading. Its `status`
  reflects the concern file as a whole and does not need to match every
  individual Item's `status`.
- `depends-on` (optional, default `[]`) — list of `<path>#<heading-slug>`
  references (see `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md`
  for the reference format) to other backlog items/sub-items that must
  finish before this one can start, e.g.
  `depends-on: [.backlog/domain-order-management.md#split-order]`. Use it
  only for sequencing between backlog items — not for pointing at
  `.domain`/`.arc42` content, which is what `implements` is for.
- `implements` (optional, default `[]`) — list of `<path>#<heading-slug>`
  references to the `.domain` (Feature/Sub-feature or Aggregate/Domain
  Service) or `.arc42` chapter this item realizes, e.g.
  `implements: [.domain/order-management/features.md#feature-checkout]`.
  This is the standard way to relate a backlog item to the feature, domain
  chapter, or architecture chapter it delivers — prefer it over the
  general-purpose `related` field for this specific relationship, since it
  gives the tooling an explicit "implements" edge rather than a
  generic tag.
