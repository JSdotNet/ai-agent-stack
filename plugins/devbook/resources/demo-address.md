name: demo-address
description: The versioned contract for pointing into a click demo and talking to one — the screen and walkthrough address a chapter's demo field and a note carry, and the four postMessage messages between a demo and the frame that hosts it. Owned by devbook; followed by the demo template, spec-manager, and Backlog.

# Demo Address

This is `devbook.demo.address@1`. devbook owns it; the demo template's script, spec-manager,
and Backlog follow it, and none of them extends it. A change that breaks a reader raises the
version, and every message carries it as `v`. Why a demo exists and where it lives is
`.devbook/arc42/adr/demos.md` in this repository.

## The Address

```text
<file>#<screen>[/<anchor>][?role=<key>&flags=<key>,<key>&vp=<key>]
<file>#walkthrough/<id>[/<step>]
```

- **`<file>`** is the demo's repository path, as a `demo` field writes it per
  `rules/devbook-chapter-metadata.md`. A message leaves it out and starts at `#`: the frame
  already names the file, and a demo never knows its own path.
- **`<screen>`** is the `id` of a `section[data-screen]`. Required for a screen address.
- **`<anchor>`** is a `data-anchor` value inside that screen. It narrows the address to one
  element.
- **The query** records the panel's state: `role` one actor key, `flags` a comma-separated
  list of feature-flag keys switched on, `vp` one viewport. Every key is the one `demo-model`
  lists, which is the repository's own `key` for that actor, flag, or setting. An omitted
  parameter means the panel's default.
- **`walkthrough/<id>`** names a walkthrough by its own `id` in `demo-model`; when it plays a
  `#### Scenario:`, that id is the scenario's slug. `<step>` is a 1-based step number; omitted,
  the walkthrough opens at its first step. `walkthrough` is therefore never a screen id.

Every part resolves against `demo-model`, the `application/json` script with that id: an
address naming a screen, anchor, walkthrough, step, or key it does not list does not resolve.

## The Messages

A host frame and the demo exchange plain objects through `postMessage`, each
`{ "type": "<message>", "v": 1, ... }`. Ignore a message whose `type` is unknown or whose
`v` is higher than the reader's.

| Message | Direction | Payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `demo:ready` | demo → host | `template`: the template version; `screens`, `anchors`, `walkthroughs`: the lists from `demo-model`, each walkthrough with its `id` and `steps` |
| `demo:location` | demo → host | `address`: the current address; in annotate mode also `element`, the address of the clicked `data-anchor` |
| `demo:goto` | host → demo | `address`: the address to open — screen and panel state set, anchor highlighted, walkthrough at its step |
| `demo:pins` | host → demo | `addresses`: every address that carries a note, shown as pins; an empty list clears them |

The demo sends `demo:ready` once its panel is built and `demo:location` on every navigation.
A host compares `demo:ready` with the addresses it stores to find the ones that no longer
resolve. A `demo:goto` whose address does not resolve changes nothing.

## The Frame

- **No parent frame, no messages.** A demo opened from disk or in its own tab, where
  `window.parent === window`, sends nothing and ignores every message.
- **Sandbox without same-origin.** The host frames the demo with `sandbox` set and
  `allow-same-origin` absent — `allow-scripts` is the only token a demo needs. The demo runs
  at an opaque origin, so it reaches no host storage or cookie, and messages are its only
  channel. The demo posts to `"*"`, since an opaque origin cannot name its parent; the host
  accepts a message only when `event.source` is the frame it created.
