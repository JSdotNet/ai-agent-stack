# Orchestrate Backlog Knowledge (`.backlog/`)

Route every `.backlog/` change through this skill instead of hand-authoring
items directly, so drafted work items stay consistent in quality, structure,
and metadata, and so GitHub Issue sync stays in lockstep with the saved
artifact.

## Input Expectations

- Target concern file: `<concern-type>-<concern-slug>.md`, where
  `concern-type` is `domain` (matches a `.domain/<context>` folder), `feature`
  (cross-cutting, spans contexts), or `architecture` (matches an `.arc42`
  chapter/topic).
- Whether this is a new Item, a new Sub-item under an existing Item, or a
  status/content update to an existing one.
- Whether the item should be published/synced to a GitHub Issue.
- Any known relations: which `.domain` feature/aggregate or `.arc42` chapter
  this item implements, and which other backlog items it depends on.

If the concern file, item shape, or relations are not stated, derive them in
Stage 1 from the request and the existing `.backlog/` contents, and continue.

## Workflow Stages

> Agent transitions require explicit user approval before switching. The drafting
> and publishing skills below are recommended, not required — if one is not
> installed, perform the step directly using the same instruction files and
> continue.

### Stage 1: Context Loading

- Load `knowledge-backlog.instructions.md` and
  `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md` (task-scoped, not baseline
  context).
- Load only the target concern file (create it from the template if it does
  not exist yet) — not the whole `.backlog/` folder.
- If the item will carry `implements`, load only the referenced `.domain` or
  `.arc42` chapter to confirm the target heading/path is correct.
- If the scope was not given, derive the concern file and item shape here and
  state them before continuing.

**Agents:** none (context loading only)

### Stage 2: Item Drafting

- For a new Item or Sub-item, draft its content with the matching skill for
  quality/shape: `to-epic`, `to-story`, or `to-bug`. These skills
  shape content quality, not a stored type label — the saved artifact still
  uses the plain Item/Sub-item chapter structure from
  `knowledge-backlog.instructions.md`.
- Nest Sub-items under their parent Item in the same concern file, matching
  the `domain.md` Aggregate/Entity nesting pattern.
- For a content/status update to an existing item, edit in place without
  re-running the drafting skill unless the description materially changes.

**Skills Used:** `to-epic`, `to-story`, `to-bug`

### Stage 3: Metadata & Cross-Reference Enforcement

- Add or update the chapter metadata block on every new/edited Item and
  Sub-item: `status` required (`draft`, `ready`, `in-progress`, `done`,
  `blocked`); `depends-on`, `implements`, `related`, `issue`, `effort`,
  `roadmap` optional and omitted when empty.
- Add or update the file-level metadata block directly under the concern
  file's `# <Concern Name>` heading.
- Use `depends-on` only for sequencing against other backlog items/sub-items;
  use `implements` for the `.domain` Feature/Sub-feature, Aggregate/Domain
  Service, or `.arc42` chapter this item realizes; use `related` for any
  other general cross-folder tag.
- If a chapter heading or file was renamed or moved, update every `related`,
  `depends-on`, or `implements` entry elsewhere that references its old
  `<path>#<heading-slug>` or `<path>`.

**Agents:** none (structural enforcement)

### Stage 4: Publish / Sync (optional)

- If the item is ready to track in GitHub, hand off to `create-github-issue`
  (new item) or `update-github-issue` (existing item) so the issue body
  matches the saved artifact rather than diverging.
- Record the returned issue reference in the item's `issue` metadata field.
- Regenerate the derived index when the repository ships the generator:
  `node .github/tools/knowledge-meta/build.mjs --scope .backlog`, and confirm it
  reports no broken references. If it reports problems, hand off to
  `knowledge-base-validate`.
- For end-to-end delivery spanning planning through implementation, note
  that the user should continue with `orch-feature` or `orch-bug` rather than
  working ad hoc from the backlog file alone.

**Skills Used:** `create-github-issue`, `update-github-issue`

## Usage Pattern

```text
Invoke: orch-backlog
- Concern: feature-checkout
- Item: "Support partial refunds" (new Item, type: story)
- Implements: .domain/order-management/features.md#feature-refunds
- Publish: yes
```

## Output Expectations

- `.backlog/<concern-type>-<concern-slug>.md` updated following the exact
  structure in `knowledge-backlog.instructions.md`.
- Every touched Item/Sub-item and the file itself carry a correct metadata
  block per `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md`.
- `depends-on`/`implements`/`related` correctly distinguished and kept in
  sync with any file/heading renames.
- GitHub Issue created or updated and its reference recorded, when
  publishing was requested.

## Canvas Interface

This skill reports progress through the `orch-dashboard` canvas extension shipped
by the `copilot-app` plugin. If the extension is not installed, skip the canvas
calls below and continue through standard chat interaction. Follow the provider-safe
dashboard contract in `plugins/copilot-app/instructions/orch-shared-phases.instructions.md`;
prefer `extensionId: "plugin:copilot-app:orch-dashboard"` when opening or inspecting the
canvas.

- Open the dashboard per the shared contract, then call `start_run` with
  `skillId: "orch-backlog"` and these stages: Context Loading, Item
  Drafting, Metadata & Cross-Reference Enforcement, Publish / Sync
  (optional).
- Before each stage, call `update_stage` with `status: "in_progress"`.
- After each stage, call `update_stage` again with `status: "done"` (or
  `"blocked"`/`"skipped"`) and an `output` summary — e.g. drafted item
  content, metadata fixes applied, or publish/sync results.
- Call `finish_run` with the final status and a summary once the backlog
  change is complete.
- During **Item Drafting**, also open/update `markdown-canvas`
  (`markdown-preview`) with the drafted epic/story/bug content, per the
  `copilot-app` plugin's `instructions/canvas-usage.instructions.md`. Optional;
  skip gracefully if not installed.

## Reference

- `knowledge-backlog.instructions.md`
- `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md`
- `assets/routing-snippet.md` — optional repository-local context-loading and
  routing policy; this plugin ships structure rules, not routing policy.
